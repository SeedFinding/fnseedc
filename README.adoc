= PDF / Articles

== WorldGen Specifics
* https://gist.github.com/XI64/0480256ed2836e4d301210899551c659[World Generation Overview written by TelepathicGrunt]
* Vizard Mod in #Tools section
* https://github.com/hube12/genlayer[Layer Generation python raw code by hube12 <???>]
* The https://youtu.be/YyVAaJqYAfE[Alan Zucconi video] provides a decent top level overview of the process.
* https://www.redblobgames.com/maps/terrain-from-noise/[Redblobgames on terrain from noise] and https://towardsdatascience.com/replicating-minecraft-world-generation-in-python-1b491bc9b9a4[Replicating Minecraft World Generation in Python] - While not for minecraft specifically, they do explain a few related concepts very well.

_Because of the mojank code quality , there are hardly any relevant articles available for WorldGen, the current best way is to read Minecraft code (considered not read friendly) , if not then the libraries :-> specifically : KaptainWutax's libraries, neil's libraries and cubiomes (In general , code that can mimic world generatiom)_

== Modular Arithmetic

* https://www.math.upenn.edu/~mlazar/math170/notes06-2.pdf[Notes on modular Arithmetic]
* https://davidaltizio.web.illinois.edu/ModularArithmetic.pdf[More notes ]
* https://people.cs.clemson.edu/~goddard/texts/discreteMath/C2.pdf[Class Notes on Modular Arithmetic]

* NERD : https://wstein.org/ent/ent.pdf[Elementary Number Theory: Primes, Congruences, and Secrets by William Stein]
* NERD : https://www.math.wustl.edu/~matkerr/NTCbook.pdf[Lecture Notes in Number Theory and Cryptography by Matt Kerr]

----

The NERD documents are long and are only recommended if you want to start from the basics, 
especially the William Stein notes are by far better to start with.
Pick any one of the top 4 modular arithmetic notes if confused. 
Then for the follow up read the modular equivalences article.
