* NERD : https://wstein.org/ent/ent.pdf[Elementary Number Theory: Primes, Congruences, and Secrets by William Stein]
* NERD : https://www.math.wustl.edu/~matkerr/NTCbook.pdf[Lecture Notes in Number Theory and Cryptography by Matt Kerr]

----

The NERD documents are long and are only recommended if you want to start from the basics, 
especially the William Stein notes are by far better to start with.
Pick any one of the top 4 modular arithmetic notes if confused. 
Then for the follow up read the modular equivalences article.
